    <h1>How to play TRENCH GAME</h1>
    <ol>
        <img src="images/instructions1.png" alt="The title text saying 'CIRCLES TURN' over an open battlefield">
        <li>Turns are decided at random! You'll see whose move it is at the beginning of each turn. Click a shape to select them.</li>
        <br>
        <img src="images/instructions2.png" alt="A circle with the orders menu open over it. A health kit sits on the circle's left. Squares hide behind walls and in the trenches to its right.">
        <li>Here's a standard TRENCH GAME scene. You can do three things with your turn. This circle could:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>pick up the health kit on its left.</li>
            <li>move to the position of your mouse, when you click anywhere within the circle labeled 'MOVE'</li>
            <li>shoot a bullet towards the position of your mouse, when you click inside the circle labeled 'SHOOT'</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <img src="images/instructions3.png" alt="A circle general with the orders menu open over it and its squad standing around it, ready to move out.">
        <li>Note! Generals (the shapes with smaller shapes inside them) tell the shapes around them where to go. All the circles around this circle general would move along with it.</li>
        <br>
        <img src="images/instructions4.png" alt="A circle stands alone, ready to fight a squad of squares. One of the squares has a plus sign over it, making it stronger.">
        <li>The square with the plus sign on it is a regular square that has picked up a health kit. It is a "strong" square. Circles can also be "strong" if they pick up a health kit.</li>
        <br>
        <img src="images/instructions5.png" alt="The circle has been shot, but so has the strong square. They both took hits from the fight, but only the strong square is not injured.">
        <li>After a fight, you'll probably find some injured soldiers. You can tell they're injured because of the dots on them. The circle can heal back to regular health by picking up the health kit.</li>
        <br>
        <img src="images/instructions6.png" alt="A trench divides an open field. A circle above the trench shoots a square above the trench, while the bullets fly over the shapes still dug in.">
        <li>The last big thing to learn about is walls and trenches. The circles in the trench on the left can't shoot the square in the center because they're in a trench, but the circle on the far left can. On the other hand, the square can't shoot down into the trench. It can only shoot at things above ground.</li>
        <br>
        <img src="images/instructions7.png" alt="The squares have crossed the plain into the circles' trench, and they have started to clash inside.">
        <li>Trenches aren't absolute security, though. The squares from the right trench in the last picture have jumped into the circles' trench, and they can now fight each other. Walls provide cover inside trenches, too.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I hope you enjoy TRENCH GAME a lot. Please teach your friends to play and stay safe!</p>
